# Tailored Configurations

  ## Out-of-the-Box Configuration
</div>

Smarteeva is designed for flexibility and prioritizes configuration over code whenever possible. The first port of call for tailoring the system is via no-code configuration using the familiar Salesforce interface.

  ## Pre-Built Extensions
</div>

Next, Smarteeva also maintains a library of code /snippets and unmanaged packages that can be used to extend functionality. These offer a starting point for common customizations, empowering clients to tailor the system without starting from scratch.

  ## Custom Development Services
</div>

When configuration and existing code aren't sufficient to meet unique requirements, Smarteeva's team works closely with clients to perform tailored configurations and may develop custom code. During implementation, the team will discuss your specific needs and explore the best approach to tailor the system.
