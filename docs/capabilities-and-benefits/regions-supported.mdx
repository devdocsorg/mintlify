  ## Extensibility
</div>

Smarteeva can be extended to support additional regions such as Australia and Japan with custom code, allowing for
further global compliance flexibility.

### MORE System in the UK

Following Brexit, the UK has initiated the development of its own reporting system:

- **MORE System (Manufacturerâ€™s Online Reporting Environment):** The UK's new Manufacturer's Online Reporting
  Environment (MORE) system, effective from September 1, 2023, replaces the old email-based process. Managed by the
  MHRA, it requires manufacturers to register and report incidents directly on the platform.
- **Smarteeva's integration of the MORE system is in early-access**
