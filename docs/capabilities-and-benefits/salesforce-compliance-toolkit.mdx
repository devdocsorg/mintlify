  ## Salesforce Native
</div>

Manage complex medical device regulations and ensure product safety without an army of developers or endless lines of code. Smarteeva, a Salesforce-native "Compliance Toolkit," empowers both business users and developers to configure and customize a comprehensive solution, seamlessly integrated within your existing Salesforce environment.

Smarteeva prioritizes configuration over code, empowering users to tailor the system with minimal coding. However, developers can leverage Salesforce's Apex language and APIs for advanced customizations, extending the system's capabilities even further.
