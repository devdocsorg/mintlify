# Best Practices and Troubleshooting for Decision Trees

## Introduction

Decision Trees in Smarteeva provide a powerful way to create dynamic questionnaires and forms within Salesforce. They enable administrators to guide users through a series of questions based on branching logic, capturing responses for analysis and workflow automation.

## Understanding the Element Field

### Purpose of the Element Field

The Element field in Decision Tree questions acts as a unique identifier for each question within a module, similar to an API name.

### Best Practices for Manually Editing the Element Field

It should be automatically populated with a value when a question is created or edited, ensuring consistency and avoiding potential conflicts.
However, there may be some instances where you need to manually edit it. In such cases:

1. Ensure Uniqueness
2. Use Consistent Naming
3. Edit Elements Carefully
4. Avoid Confusion with Question Text

## Module Types and Limitations

### Changing Module Types: Risks and Recommendations

Changing a module's type after creation is technically possible but strongly discouraged due to:

1. Configuration Conflicts
2. Data Integrity Issues
3. System Limitations

#### Best Practice Recommendation

Do not change the module type after creation. Create a new module if a different type is needed.

### Future System Enhancements

Validation rules to prevent changing module types after creation are planned.

## Cloning Modules and Version Management

### How to Clone Modules

### 1) Navigate to the Decision Tree Builder
Go to the list of existing modules.

### 2) Select the Module to Clone
Choose the module you wish to clone.

### 3) Click on Clone
Use the clone action associated with the module.

### 4) Edit Module Details
Change the Module Name to reflect the new version or purpose.

### 5) Save the New Module
Complete the cloning process by saving.

### Managing Module Versions

#### Activation and Deactivation of Modules

1. Only One Active Version
2. Manual Deactivation Required

#### Best Practice Recommendations

1. Use Clear Naming Conventions
2. Maintain Consistent Key Values
3. Regularly Deactivate Unused Versions

## Customizing the Decision Tree Branding

### Changing the Logo in Decision Tree Preview

### Steps to Customize the Logo

### 1) Access Custom Settings
Navigate to Salesforce Setup and find Custom Settings.

### 2) Edit Smarteeva Setup
Click on Manage next to Smarteeva Setup.

### 3) Set the Image Path
Enter the URL of the desired image for your logo.

### 4) Save the Changes
Click Save to apply the changes.

### 5) Refresh the Decision Tree
Navigate back to your Decision Tree and refresh the page.

### Important Considerations

1. Default Logo Behavior
2. Image Accessibility Requirements
3. Optimal Image Dimensions

## Limitations in Specific Module Types

### Editing Responses in Chatbot Modules

#### Limitations

1. No Editing After Submission
2. No 'Edit Response' Feature

### Form Questions in Chatbot Modules

#### Limitations

1. Single Form Element Display
2. Multiple Form Elements Not Supported

#### Best Practice Recommendations

1. Use Single-Element Forms
2. Split Forms if Necessary

## Navigation Behaviors in Decision Trees

### Detailed Branching Navigation

1. Flexible Navigation
2. Dynamic Path Exploration
3. Automatic Tab Transitions

### Regular Branching Navigation

1. Linear Navigation
2. Parent-Child Structure
3. No Tab Re-navigation

### Best Practices for Using Tabs

1. Use in Supported Module Types
2. Organize Logical Sections
3. Ensure Consistent Flow
4. Avoid Overcomplicating Navigation

## Known Issues and UI Bugs

### Issues with Labels Displaying Incorrectly

#### Workaround

1. Be Aware of the UI Bug
2. Report Persistent Issues

### Validation Errors in Form Type Modules

#### Reason for Limitation

The system enforces a single-question rule in Form Module Types.

#### Best Practice

1. Design Single Question Forms
2. Consider Alternative Module Types

## Best Practices Summary

1. Element Field Usage
2. Avoid Changing Module Types
3. Clone Modules Carefully
4. Customize Branding Thoughtfully
5. Understand Module Limitations
6. Navigate with Care
7. Monitor UI Issues
