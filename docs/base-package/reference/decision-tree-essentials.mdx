# Decision Tree Essentials - Overview Reference

![Decision Tree Essentials](/snippets/generic/generic-ui-images-01-decision-tree-does-company-have-responsibility.jpg)

## Introduction to Decision Trees

In Smarteeva, Decision Trees are interactive workflows that guide users through a series of questions or information
collection steps. They are designed to help users make decisions, provide information, or complete tasks based on their
specific needs or circumstances.

Decision Trees consist of various components, such as Content Modules, Content Items, and Choices, which work together
to create a dynamic, personalized experience for each user. By understanding these components and how they interact, you
can create effective Decision Trees that streamline processes, gather important data, and provide valuable insights.

## 1. Core Components

| Component                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content Module                          | A configuration or template that defines the structure, content, and behavior of an interactive questionnaire or workflow within Smarteeva.                                                          |
| Decision Tree                           | Often used interchangeably with Content Module, but generally refers to an instance of a Content Module that is linked to a specific record or event, capturing a user's responses and interactions. |
| Module Type                             | Defines the overall structure and behavior of a Content Module, influencing how Content Items are organized and presented.                                                                           |
| Content Item                            | An individual element within a Content Module, representing a question, information display, or data collection point.                                                                               |
| Content Item Choice                     | An option or input associated with a Content Item, allowing for user interaction and decision-making within the Content Module.                                                                      |
| Content Item Parent ("Parent Question") | A field used in specific Module Types (primarily "Regular Branching") to create hierarchical relationships between Content Items, enabling complex question flows.                                   |
| Event                                   | A record that is created when a user interacts with a Decision Tree (an instance of a Content Module). It captures the user's responses and other relevant information.                              |
| Answer                                  | A record that stores a user's response to a specific Content Item within an Event.                                                                                                                   |
| Answer Item                             | A record that stores detailed information about a user's response, particularly for form-type questions with multiple inputs.                                                                        |

## 3. Content Item Types

### Branching Types

| Type                       | Description                                                                                                   | Example                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Branching**              | Presents a question with multiple predefined options. User's selection determines the next Content Item.      | "What type of issue are you experiencing?" with choices like "Technical", "Billing", "Other".                              |
| **Image Button Branching** | Displays an image with clickable areas. User's selection of an area determines the next Content Item.         | An image of a car with clickable areas for different parts. (Not currently used, available for future implementation)      |
| **Branching Formula**      | Uses conditions based on user input and associated record values to dynamically determine the branching path. | Branching based on combination of user answers and Salesforce record field values like "Account Type" or "Complaint Risk". |

### Selection Types

| Type                 | Description                                                                                 | Example                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Choices**          | User selects one option. May influence subsequent questions or be used for data collection. | "What is your preferred contact method?" with choices like "Email", "Phone", "Mail".             |
| **Choices Multiple** | Allows users to select one or more predefined options.                                      | "Which products are you interested in?" with choices like "Product A", "Product B", "Product C". |

### Data Collection Types

| Type                 | Description                                                   | Example                                                                              |

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Content Piece** | Displays static information without requiring user input. | A disclaimer message, instructions, or a company logo. |

## 4. Decision Tree Flow

The flow of a Decision Tree is determined by the types of Content Items used and how their choices are configured.

| Flow Mechanism                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Branching Logic               | Content Items like "Branching" and "Image Button Branching" directly control the next question based on user selection.                                                                                   |
| Data Collection and Influence | "Choices" and "Choices Multiple" gather information that can influence later questions or be used for data analysis.                                                                                      |
| Dynamic Flow with Formulas    | "Branching Formula" uses predefined conditions based on user input and associated record values to dynamically alter the flow. It allows for personalized questionnaire paths based on specific criteria. |
| Hierarchical Structure        | In "Regular Branching" modules, the "Content Item Parent" field plays a crucial role in defining the hierarchy and influencing navigation.                                                                |

building and managing Decision Trees.

| Technical Term            | UI Term         |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Content Module            | Decision Tree   |
| Content Item              | Question        |
| Content Item Choice       | Choice          |
| Content Item Parent Field | Parent Question |

## 6. Identifiers, Associations, and Data Integration

| Identifier/Association | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key Value              | A unique identifier for a Content Module. Required to ensure that there can't be multiple modules with the same name. Acts like an ID for the module.                                  |
| Element                | A unique identifier field for each Content Module element (question, choice, etc.) within a module. Usually auto-populated to mirror a corresponding Text field. (Exact usage unclear) |
| Associated Object Name | A field that specifies which Salesforce object the content module is associated with. Used in regular branching and form type modules.                                                 |
| Field to be Linked     | A field that specifies which Salesforce object field should be populated with the answer to a specific question.                                                                       |

## 7. Ad Hoc Decision Trees

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ad Hoc Decision Tree | A feature that allows non-admin users to create and modify decision trees on the fly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Guest User Access    | A setup allowing guest users to access and interact with Ad Hoc Decision Trees. Requires configuring a custom public site in Salesforce and associating it with a guest user profile. Only the "Form" module type is supported for guest users. A custom permission set, "Custom Guest User Permissions," must be assigned to provide appropriate access levels. |

## 8. Decision Tree Component

The `Decision Tree` Lightning component integrates dynamic questionnaires into Salesforce record pages, providing
interactive workflows and data collection capabilities directly within the Salesforce interface.

| Configuration | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Single Survey | Displays a single instance of the questionnaire, automatically creating an Event if none exists.             |
| List          | Displays a list of all Events associated with the record, allowing users to view or edit previous responses. |

## 9. Permissions

| Permission Set                               | Purpose                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decision Tree Platform Permissions Admin** | Grants administrators the ability to configure, manage, and oversee decision trees. |
| **Decision Tree Platform Permissions User**  | Allows regular users to interact with and provide responses within decision trees.  |

## 10. Decision Tree Versions

| Version | Status                 | Design Focus                                            | Admin Interface                                  | Compatibility                         |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| V1      | Frozen, bug fixes only | User interfaces for form interaction                    | Lacks extensive validation, easy to misconfigure | -                                     |
| V2      | Current version        | Improved admin experience while maintaining V1 benefits | More robust (implied)                            | Forward compatible with many V1 trees |

### Configuring Version

- `Custom Settings` -> `Smarteeva Setup` -> `Enable Decision Tree V2`

### Notes

- All new customers should use be using the newest version.
- V2 reuses the same models as V1, and for many trees, it will be forward compatible.
- V1 was designed pragmatically, with all care going into the interfaces used by regular users interacting with the forms.
  Consequently, the admin interface lacks extensive validation, making it easy to configure nonsensical setups due to the
  underlying flexibility of the models that support all variations.

## 11. Version Control

Use the clone feature to create a new version of a content module. Only one version will be active for any given "key
value."
