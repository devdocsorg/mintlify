# Ad Hoc Decision Trees

## Introduction

In the Smarteeva platform, Ad Hoc Decision Trees empower regular users—not just administrators—to create custom decision trees on the fly. This functionality is particularly useful when users need to capture additional information or feedback that isn't covered by standard forms or pre-configured decision trees. By enabling Ad Hoc Decision Trees, organizations can enhance flexibility in data collection, streamline workflows, and improve responsiveness to unique scenarios.

This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to enable and configure Ad Hoc Decision Trees in Smarteeva. It covers the setup process, allowable module types, differences between admin and user interfaces, activation procedures, and best practices for email distribution.


## Understanding Ad Hoc Decision Trees

Ad Hoc Decision Trees allow regular users to create custom decision trees directly from record pages without needing admin privileges. This feature is ideal for situations where users need to gather specific information that isn't covered by existing forms or decision trees.

### Use Cases

* Capturing additional customer feedback after a service call.
* Logging information from unique scenarios that arise unexpectedly.
* Collecting data for internal processes that require user-specific forms.

By empowering users to create their own decision trees, organizations can enhance data collection flexibility and improve responsiveness to dynamic business needs.


## Enabling Ad Hoc Decision Trees

### Prerequisites

Before enabling Ad Hoc Decision Trees, ensure the following:

* Decision Tree Version 2 is enabled in your Smarteeva instance.
* You have administrative access to configure custom settings and Lightning components.

### Configuring Smarteeva Setup

#### 1) Navigate to Smarteeva Setup

* In Salesforce Setup, enter `Custom Settings` in the Quick Find box.
* Select **Smarteeva Setup**.

#### 2) Enable Module Types Allowed for Ad Hoc Feature

* Find the field **Module Types Allowed for Ad-hoc Feature**.
* Specify the module types you want to allow for ad hoc creation, separated by semicolons (`;`).
* Example: `Form;Regular Branching`
* If the field is left empty, both `Form` and `Regular Branching` module types are allowed by default.

**Note**: Only `Form` and `Regular Branching` module types are currently supported for Ad Hoc Decision Trees.

#### 3) Enable Decision Tree Version 2
