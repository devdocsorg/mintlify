# Configuring Child Record Locks

## Introduction

The "Child Record Lock" feature in Smarteeva's CAP package prevents changes to related child records when the parent record reaches a specific status. This ensures data integrity and prevents unintended modifications to related data. This guide explains how to configure these locks.

## Prerequisites

* System Administrator privileges.
* Access to the Smart Config app.
* "Audit Trail Platform Permission Set Admin" permission set (or equivalent). 
* Active Business Rule Handler (Trigger or Flow) for the target object. See:
  * [Configuring V2 Flow-Based Tracking](../audit-trail/audit-trail-setup-version-2.mdx)
  * [Configuring V1 Apex-Based Tracking](../audit-trail/audit-trail-setup-version-1.mdx)




## Configuring Child Record Lock Rules

### 1) Accessing Child Record Lock Setup

* In Smart Config, navigate to **Business Rule Configuration > Child Record Lock**.

### 2) Creating a New Rule

* Click **New**.

### 3) Selecting Target Object and Status

* **Select Object:** Choose the parent object (e.g. Complaint). The available statuses are determined by this selection.

* **Select Status:**  Choose the parent record status value (picklist value) that triggers the lock (e.g., "Closed"). *Status fields are picklists.*

### 4) Specifying Child Objects to Lock

* **Locked Children Record:** Select the related child objects to lock when the parent's status matches. These must be *child* objects related to the selected parent object.

### 5) Saving the Rule

* Click **Save**. 


## Example

To prevent changes to related Investigation records when a Complaint's Status is "Closed":

1. **Select Object:** Complaint
2. **Select Status:** Closed
3. **Locked Children Record:** Select Investigation.


## How It Works

When the parent record's status matches a configured rule, any attempts to create, update, or delete the specified related child records will result in an error, preventing the change.  This includes updating fields *within* the child records. 



## Troubleshooting

### Errors Modifying Child Records

* **Locked Child Records:** Ensure the child record isn't locked due to its parent's status. 
* **Incorrect Configuration:**  Double-check the rule and child object relationships.
* **Business Rule Handler:** Ensure it's active for the target object
