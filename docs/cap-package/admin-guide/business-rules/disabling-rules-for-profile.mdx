# Disabling Rules For Profile

## Introduction

The "Disabling Rules For Profile" feature allows administrators to create exceptions to business rules for specific user profiles. This guide explains how to configure these exceptions.

## Prerequisites

* System Administrator privileges.
* Access to the Salesforce Setup.
* Knowledge of Profile IDs you want to exclude.


## Configuring Profile-Specific Rule Exceptions

### 1) Accessing Custom Settings

* In Salesforce Setup, navigate to **Custom Settings**.
* Find and click on "Exclude Profiles for AT Validations".

/>

### 2) Managing Exclusion Settings

* Click **Manage** next to the "Exclude Profiles for AT Validations" setting.
* Click **Edit** to modify the settings.

### 3) Specifying Excluded Profiles

* In the appropriate fields, enter the Profile IDs you want to exclude:
* Child Record Lock Excluded Profiles
* Lock Field Excluded Profiles
* Required Field Excluded Profiles
* Audit Trail Excluded Profiles
* Smart Email Notification Excluded Profiles
* Separate multiple Profile IDs with commas.


### 4) Finding Profile IDs

To find a Profile ID:

1. Open the Developer Console.
2. Run this SOQL query: `SELECT Id FROM Profile WHERE Name = 'System Administrator'`
3. Copy the resulting ID.

### 5) Saving the Configuration

* Click **Save** to apply the changes.


## How It Works

When a user with an excluded profile performs actions that would normally trigger business rules, those rules are bypassed for that user.


## Considerations

* Use this feature cautiously, as it can impact data integrity and compliance tracking.
* Regularly review excluded profiles to ensure they are still necessary.
* Document any profile exclusions for auditing purposes.


## Troubleshooting

### Rules Still Applying to Excluded Profiles

* Verify the correct Profile ID is entered in the exclusion list.
* Ensure the changes were saved successfully.
* Check if the user is assigned to the correct profile.
