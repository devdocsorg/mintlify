# Introduction

## Overview

The Business Rules feature within the Smarteeva CAP package allows administrators to manage and control various business rules for different objects. It is designed to provide no-code implementations that is easily configurable, as opposed to Salesforce's native options.

## Key Features

### Object-Specific Rules

Configure rules for different objects such as Complaints, Accounts, and more.

### Multiple Rule Types
Manage various types of rules including:
- [Required Field Validations](./configuring-required-fields.mdx) 
- [Locked Field Validations](./configuring-locked-fields.mdx) 
- [Child Record Locks](./configuring-child-record-locks.mdx) 
- [Field Updates by Status](./configuring-update-field-by-status.mdx) 

## Use Cases
The Business Rules Handler is particularly useful in scenarios such as:
- Enforcing data quality standards 
- Implementing compliance requirements 
- Managing record lifecycle states 
- Controlling field editability based on record status 

## Flexible Activation
Easily enable or disable individual rules as needed. 

For specific use cases, the Business Rules Handler offers advanced configuration options:
1. **[Disabling Rules for Specific Profiles](./disabling-rules-for-profile.mdx)**: Create exceptions for certain user profiles, allowing them to bypass specific rules when necessary. 
2. **[Disabling Rules for Automation](./disabling-rules-for-automation.mdx)**: Temporarily disable rules during bulk data operations or automated processes to improve performance and prevent unnecessary rule enforcement. 

## Relationship with Audit Trail

Currently, it's unclear about the exact relationship between the Business Rule Handler and how to configure tracking.
It's our current understanding that you must configure the tracker per [Apex Trigger](../audit-trail/audit-trail-setup-version-1.mdx) or [Salesforce Flow](../audit-trail/audit-trail-setup-version-2.mdx) per object.
Contact smarteeva support if you have any questions.
