# Creating a custom MDC report page

## Introduction

Smarteeva's CAP package provides a standard MDC (Meaningful Data Change) Report page, focusing on the `Complaint` object. This is sufficient for many use cases, but sometimes you need a specialized MDC report focusing on a different object as the root, such as `Account` or `Contact`.  For more information about MDC Reports, see [MDC Reports Intro](./intro.mdx). This guide walks you through creating custom MDC report pages using Lightning App Builder and custom tabs, giving you the flexibility to tailor MDC reporting to your specific needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **System Administrator Access:** You'll need the necessary permissions to create and modify Lightning Pages and Tabs.
* **Lightning App Builder Familiarity:** A basic understanding of the Lightning App Builder is helpful. Get started with the Lightning App Builder on Trailhead: [Lightning App Builder](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/search/learning?tab=LEARNING&keywords=lightning-app-builder)
* **MDC Configuration Knowledge:** Review the MDC configuration process to understand how object relationships and field selections affect the report output. For more information, see [Configuring Meaningful Fields](./configuring-meaningful-fields.mdx).

## Building a Custom Lightning Page

The first step is to create a Lightning Page that will host the MDC report component.

### 1) Access the Lightning App Builder

* From Setup, search for and select **Lightning App Builder**.



### 2) Start a New App Page

* Click **New**, choose **App Page**, and click **Next**.

### 3) Name Your Page

* Give your page a descriptive label (e.g., "Account MDC Report Page"). This label will also be used for the tab name later.  Click **Next**.


### 4) Select a Template

* Choose the **One Region** template. This provides a clean layout for the MDC report. Click **Finish**.

### 5) Add the MDC Component

* In the Components pane, search for "MDCOnRecord" and drag it onto the page canvas. This component displays the actual MDC report.

### 6) Configure the Root Object

* In the `MDCOnRecord` component's properties, under "Set Top Level Object," enter the **API Name** of the object you want to use as the root for this report (e.g., `Account`).

### 7) Add the (Hidden) Processor

* While not visually displayed, the `MDCProcessor` Visualforce page handles background processing for the report. Add a Visualforce component to the page, select `MDCProcessor` as the page name, and set its height to `0` to hide it.

### 8) Save Your Work

* Click **Save** to save your Lightning Page.



## Creating the Tab

Now that the page is ready, create a tab to make it accessible to users.

### 1) Go to Tabs

* In Setup, search for and select **Tabs**.

### 2) New Lightning Page Tab

* Under "Lightning Page Tabs," click **New**.

### 3) Configure Tab Details


* **Lightning Page:** Select the Lightning page you just created (e.g., "Account MDC Report Page").
* **Tab Label:** Enter a user-friendly name for the tab (e.g., "Account MDC Report").
* **Tab Name:** This usually auto-populates.
* **Choose Icon:** Select a relevant icon for the tab.
* **Description:** (Optional) Provide a brief description.

### 4) Manage Tab Visibility

* Choose which profiles can see this tab. By default, it's visible to all. Click **Save**.

## Accessing the Custom Report

Users with access to the tab can now find it in the App Launcher or navigation bar. This new report will provide an MDC-focused view rooted in the object you specified.
