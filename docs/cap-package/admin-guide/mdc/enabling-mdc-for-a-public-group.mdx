# Enabling MDC for a Public Group

This guide explains how to enable MDC reports for a specific group

## Prerequisites

## Steps

### 4) Select Review Group(s)

- In the **Select Review Group(s)** section, choose the public group(s) that should have access to review MDC reports.
  - **Available Groups:** Lists all public groups in your Salesforce org.
  - **Selected Groups:** The groups you've chosen to grant access to.
  - **Gotcha:** This is a **global setting**, not specific to the current MDC configuration.
