# Managing Email Subscriptions

## Introduction

Smarteeva's CAP package allows you to subscribe to public email notifications for specific events or record changes within Salesforce.  This user guide explains how to manage your subscriptions.

## Accessing Available Subscriptions

### 1) Navigate to Smart Email Notifications

* From the App Launcher, search for and select **Smart Email Notification**.


### 2) Open the Available Public Email Services Tab

* Click the **Available Public Email Services** tab. This tab lists all the email notification services that have been made public by an administrator.

## Subscribing to a Service

### 1) Locate the Service



* Find the email service you want to subscribe to in the list. Each service will have a name (e.g., "Account Industry is Banking") indicating the object and criteria it's based on.

### 2) Subscribe to the Service

* Check the **Subscribe** checkbox next to the service name.

/>


You will now receive email notifications whenever the defined criteria are met for the specified object.


## Unsubscribing from a Service

### 1) Locate the Service

* Find the service you want to unsubscribe from in the list.

### 2) Unsubscribe from the Service

* Uncheck the **Subscribe** checkbox next to the service name.

/>

You will no longer receive email notifications for that specific service.  You can resubscribe at any time by checking the checkbox again.


## Viewing Active Subscriptions

All your currently active subscriptions are listed on the **Available Public Email Services** tab with the **Subscribe** checkbox checked.
