Meaningful Data Change (MDC) Reports in Smarteeva provide valuable insights into data changes within your system. However, as the volume of data grows, it becomes essential to refine these reports to focus on the most relevant information. Salesforce List Views offer a powerful way to filter records based on specific criteria, and when integrated with Smarteeva's MDC Reports, they enable users to generate more targeted and meaningful reports.

In this article, we will explore how to create custom List Views in Salesforce and utilize them within Smarteeva MDC Reports to enhance your data analysis and reporting capabilities.
