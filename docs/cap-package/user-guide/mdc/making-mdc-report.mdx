# Making an MDC report for a given group

## Introduction

Meaningful Data Change (MDC) Reports in Smarteeva's CAP package provide a powerful way to track and review changes to important data within your Salesforce org. These reports can be filtered and customized to display only the relevant changes for a specific MDC group, ensuring that users can efficiently review and acknowledge the changes relevant to their responsibilities.

This guide will walk you through the process of generating an MDC report for a given group.


## Prerequisites

* Access to Smarteeva MDC Reports within your Salesforce environment.
* Membership in the MDC group for which you want to generate the report. 



## Generating the MDC Report

### 1) Navigate to MDC Reports

* In Salesforce, navigate to the **MDC Reports** tab.

### 2) Set the Date Range

* Specify the desired date range for your report using the **From** and **To** date pickers. By default, the report displays changes from the last 14 days. You can modify this to view a different time period.

    * **All Records**: Displays both reviewed and non-reviewed records. 
    * **Non-Reviewed Records**: Displays only records that haven't been reviewed.  
    * **Reviewed Records**: Displays only records that have been reviewed.

## Understanding the Report Structure

The generated MDC report displays the following information for each change:

* **Date and Time:** When the change occurred.
* **User:** Who made the change.
* **Object:** The Salesforce object that was modified (e.g., Complaint, Investigation).  
* **Record Name:**  The name or identifier of the specific record that was modified.
* **Field Name:**  The specific field that was changed.
* **Old Value:** The previous value of the field.
* **New Value:**  The new value of the field.



Child records related to the main object (e.g., Investigations related to a Complaint) are displayed hierarchically within the report. You can expand each parent record to view its associated child record changes. 


## Reviewing Changes

Once you have reviewed the changes in the report, you can mark them as reviewed to indicate that you have acknowledged them.


## Next Steps

* Review the [Reviewing A Changed Item](./reviewing-changed-item.mdx) guide to learn how to mark changes as reviewed.
