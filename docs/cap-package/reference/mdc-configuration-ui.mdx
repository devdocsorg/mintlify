# MDC Configuration UI

## New -> "New Record"

This screen is for creating a new MDC configuration, defining which objects and their related child objects are included in MDC reports.

![Screenshot](/mdc-configuration-ui-01-new-record.jpg)

### 1) Select Object

Choose the object for the configuration and see <a href="#is-default-parent">Is Default Parent</a>

### 2) Is Default Parent

This checkbox is critical and can be confusing.

**Checked**: The selected object is the primary object for the MDC report. The configuration will always be applied.

**Unchecked**: The selected object is a child object in a more complex MDC configuration. The configuration will ONLY apply when the object is queried as a child of another object in the report.

#### Notes

- To configure an MDC Report spanning multiple objects requires multiple configurations
- Only set one parent or you may have errors

### 3) Select Child Objects

Choose related child objects to include in the report.

**Available Objects**: Child objects with a direct relationship to the configured object AND that have been configured for audit trails.

**Selected Objects**: The child objects you've chosen to include.

**Gotcha**: The order of child objects in the "Selected Objects" list does NOT determine their display order in the MDC report. The report uses a hierarchical structure based on object relationships, not this list order.

### 4) Save/Cancel

Standard buttons to save or discard changes.

[//]: # "### Field Permissions"
[//]: # "Users configuring MDC must have explicit field-level permissions for the fields they want to include in the configuration. This can be counterintuitive, especially for system administrators who usually have implicit access to all fields."
[//]: #
[//]: # "### Report Generation Logic"
[//]: # "The logic for determining which records are included in an MDC report is based on the audit trail data and the meaningful fields configuration. The MDC configuration UI only controls the report's display and review access."
