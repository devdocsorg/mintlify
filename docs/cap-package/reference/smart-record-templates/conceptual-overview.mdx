# Conceptual Overview

## Introduction

Smarteeva's CAP package includes Smart Record Templates, a powerful feature that streamlines data entry and ensures data consistency in Salesforce. This reference guide provides a comprehensive overview of their purpose, benefits, and core concepts.

## Benefits

Smart Record Templates offer significant advantages:

* **Efficiency:** Reduce manual data entry and save time.
* **Consistency:** Maintain uniform data across records, improving data quality and reducing errors, especially important in regulated environments.
* **Simplified Onboarding:**  Accelerate new user training by providing pre-filled templates.
* **Increased Productivity:** Automate repetitive tasks, freeing up users for more critical activities.
* **Flexibility:** Adapt templates to diverse business needs using tags and dynamic merge fields. They can also automate the creation of related records, further streamlining workflows. 

## Core Concepts

### Templates


Reusable sets of pre-defined field values for specific Salesforce objects (e.g., Complaint, Account).

### Template Fields


Templates consist of fields with defined values:

* **Static Value:**  A fixed value. Example: Setting "Complaint Source" to "Phone Call."
* **Dynamic Value (Merge Field):** Context-based value using merge field syntax (`{!Object.Field}`). Example: "Complaint from `{!Complaint.Account__r.Name}` regarding `{!Complaint.Product__r.Name}`." 

### Merge Fields


Dynamically insert data from related records or the current user into template fields. See the [Merge Field Syntax](./merge-field-syntax.mdx) reference guide.

### Template Tags



Categorize and filter templates using keywords. Tags are case-insensitive and can be combined (comma-separated). Example: A template for a specific product issue could have tags like "hardware, sensor, critical."

### Related Record Templates


Automatically create and populate related (child) records on template application. Example: A Complaint template could automatically create a related Investigation record.

### Smart Record Templates Component


The Lightning component on record pages for applying templates, offering search, tag-based filtering, and a preview mechanism.

### Automated Template Application


Templates can be applied automatically based on record criteria using Apex triggers, significantly reducing manual effort. See [Automating Template Application](../../admin-guide/smart-record-templates/automating-template-application.mdx).

## How It Works

1. **Template Definition:** Admins define templates. 
2. **Component Addition:** The Smart Record Templates component is added to record pages. 
3. **Manual Application:** Users select and apply templates via the component.

4. **Automated Application:** Apex triggers automatically apply templates based on criteria. 

## Example Scenarios

* **Standardized Case Management:** Create templates for common case types (e.g., "Product Defect," "Feature Request") to ensure consistent data capture and streamline case handling.
* **Automated Account Setup:** Automatically apply account templates based on industry or account type, pre-populating relevant fields like "Account Source" or "SLA."
* **Streamlined Complaint Processing:** Use templates for common complaint categories (e.g., "Hardware Issue," "Software Bug") and automatically generate related investigation records.
