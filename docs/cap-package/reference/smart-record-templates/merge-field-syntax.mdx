# Merge Field Syntax for Smart Record Templates



## Introduction

This guide explains merge field syntax in Smarteeva's CAP package for Smart Record Templates.

## Basic Syntax

```
{!Object.Field}
```

Where:
* `Object`: The API name of the Salesforce object
* `Field`: The API name of the field



## Context and Usage

Merge fields are used within the context of the object for which the template is created.



### Example

For a Complaint template:
* **Country of Incident:** `{!Complaint.Country_of_Incident__c}`



## Important Considerations

### API Names

Use API names for both objects and fields, not labels.



### Custom Fields

Custom fields in Salesforce end with "__c". Always include this suffix for custom fields.



### Performance Considerations

Only select "Has Merge Field" for fields that actually contain merge fields. Checking this option for all fields can impact performance, especially in templates with many fields.



## Template Application

When applying a template, the system will automatically replace merge fields with the corresponding values from the record.



## Limitations

- The exact behavior and available fields may depend on your Salesforce org's configuration and any customizations made to the Smart Record Templates functionality.
- Merge fields are primarily used for field-level data.



## Troubleshooting

If merge fields are not populating as expected, double-check the following:
1. Correct API names are used for both objects and fields
2. The "Has Merge Field" option is selected for the relevant fields in your template configuration
3. The field you're trying to reference exists on the object for which the template is created
