## Introduction to MDC Reports

### Audit Overload

While the Smarteeva Audit Trail functionality is incredibly useful, and has none of the limitations of built-in
Salesforce equivalents[^1], sometimes only specific fields are of interest. Sifting through irrelevant fields while trying
to review changes is both tedious and error-prone.

### Finding Meaning Together

Complex records such as Complaints or Investigations can have a bewildering amount of fields. What is relevant and
important to one team may be considered noise by another. Smarteeva models these teams as Salesforce Public Groups. On
each object, each group can configure “Meaningful Fields”.

### Configuration Options

A primary object with optional descendants can be configured, up to 3 levels deep, to appear in the Meaningful Data
Change Report (MDC Report) tab. In most cases, this is enough, but where there is need for more than one object, a
custom MDC Report Page can be created using Lightning App Builder and bundled components.

### Review Only Meaningful Changes

Each item in an MDC Report is an object with “meaningful” changes since last review. Each item goes from “unreviewed” to
“reviewed” status, and this status is tracked per group. Only one user per group is required to review a given item.

[^1]: Limitations: Salesforce can only track up to 20 fields per object and data retention is not permanent.
